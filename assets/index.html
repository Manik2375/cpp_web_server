    <h2>Did You Know?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>In Linux, everything is a file, even devices like your keyboard, mouse, or network connections. Want to read input from your keyboard? You can just read from /dev/input/eventX like it’s a text file. It’s a super flexible design! 🐧</li>
        <li>You can make your Linux terminal talk! By installing espeak and typing espeak "Hello world!", your computer will literally speak the text out loud. Some devs even make their terminal narrate system messages for fun.</li>
